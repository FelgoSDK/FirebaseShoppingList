The app uses the V-Play Firebase Plugin: https://v-play.net/doc/plugin-firebase/

Why use V-Play Plugins for your Apps and Games?

There is no need to re-invent the wheel when integrating third party services and platform-specific functionality to your Qt 5 apps & games. V-Play plugins save you weeks in comparison with in-house development, both during implementation and later on for maintaining and updating third-party libraries.

V-Play Plugins use native, platform-specific functionality, meaning that your app seamlessly integrates with existing platform experiences. They incorporate platform-specific human interface guidelines and follow best-practices down to the detail.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This game was made with V-Play Engine. You need the engine which is freely available on http://v-play.net/ for all desktop platforms. V-Play Plugins are only available starting with the V-Play Indie license and above. See http://v-play.net/pricing for more information.

1. Go to http://v-play.net/, register, download and install the free V-Play SDK.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Create a valid V-Play license key that includes all the plugins at http://v-play.net/developers/license.
4. Open the project file .pro in QtCreator (comes with V-Play SDK).
5. Add the created license key to the App item in the Main.qml file of the project.
6. Hit run to start the app.

Note: The Firebase plugin only works on mobile platforms like Android or iOS. See http://v-play.net/doc/vplay-deployment/ to learn how to deploy a V-Play App to mobile devices.
