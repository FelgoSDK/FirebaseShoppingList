The app uses the Felgo Firebase Plugin: https://felgo.com/doc/plugin-firebase/

Why use Felgo Plugins for your Apps and Games?

There is no need to re-invent the wheel when integrating third party services and platform-specific functionality to your Qt 5 apps & games. Felgo plugins save you weeks in comparison with in-house development, both during implementation and later on for maintaining and updating third-party libraries.

Felgo Plugins use native, platform-specific functionality, meaning that your app seamlessly integrates with existing platform experiences. They incorporate platform-specific human interface guidelines and follow best-practices down to the detail.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This game was made with Felgo. You need the SDK which is freely available on https://felgo.com/ for all desktop platforms. Felgo Plugins are only available starting with the Felgo Indie license and above. See https://felgo.com/pricing for more information.

1. Go to https://felgo.com/, register, download and install the free Felgo SDK.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Create a valid Felgo license key that includes all the plugins at https://felgo.com/developers/license.
4. Open the project file .pro in QtCreator (comes with Felgo SDK).
5. Add the created license key to the App item in the Main.qml file of the project.
6. Hit run to start the app.

Note: The Firebase plugin only works on mobile platforms like Android or iOS. See https://felgo.com/doc/felgo-deployment/ to learn how to deploy a Felgo App to mobile devices.
